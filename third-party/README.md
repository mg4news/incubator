# Thirdparty
This file serves simple as a place holder for the "thirdparty" directory. None of the components pulled by CMake are added to git, but the readme file ensures the directory is not empty. 

## Patches
At such time as patches are needed thay will be added in a ./patches subdirectory. They will be named:
- <component name>_ <4 digit patch number>_<description>.patch

For example: gtest_0001_fix_warning.patch
